- Course Code : BCS502
- Credits : 1

## Course objectives:
* Explain the fundamentals of computer networks.
* Apply the concepts of computer networks to demonstrate the working of various layers and protocols in communication network.
* Analyze the principles of protocol layering in modern communication systems.
* Demonstrate various Routing protocols and their services using tools such as Cisco packet tracer.

## Lab Experiments

1. Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the
queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped.

2. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6
nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

3. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion
window for different source / destination.

4. Develop a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).

5. Develop a program to implement a sliding window protocol in the data link layer.

6. Develop a program to find the shortest path between vertices using the Bellman-Ford and path
vector routing algorithm.

7. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name
and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present.

8. Develop a program on a datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client
side, typed at the server side.

9. Develop a program for a simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.

10. Develop a program for congestion control using a leaky bucket algorithm.
